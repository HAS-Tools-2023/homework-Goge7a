8/10 -- Mostly your answers are correct but some of them are not quite right (2-4). Also you have zero formatting on this so its very hard to read. At a minimum you need to have some formatting to make it easy to follow. 

1. What is Github and what is Git (and how are they different)
Git is a folder that tracks changes  
Github uses the code from Git which can be distributed as repositories. 
2.What is a repo and why is it different  from a folder
A folder can store files from a computer whereas a repo also stores files but has software packages where 
3.The difference between local, remote, origin
Origin and remote are practically the same thing. So the example I would use is that the 501 HAS github that Dr. Condon created would be the origin and our accounts connecting to that one are local. 
4.Ways to get your own version of a repo and how they are different (Clone, Fork)
Cloning takes all the source files and puts them onto your computer.
Forking can take someone else�s project as a starting point for your own. This does not require a request and will be a clone of the repo. 
5.How to add changes to your repo: Staging, committing and pushing
Staging = staging is the prepping and shows the changes that the user would like to make. 
Committing = Moves the changes through onto the repo.
Pushing = is basically uploading the committed changes onto the origin 
6.How to get the latest remote changes locally: Pulling and fetching
Fetching = gets other repos or work done by other people and without merging changes onto your own branch
Pulling = similar to downloading repos or work done by other people. However, this will merge changes onto your own branch. 
7.Branches � what are they are and why we use them
This can be used to continue to do work without saving changes to the main line.
This is really helpful for testing code out and if there are errors, the user can just delete the branch without affecting the original code.
8.What is a pull request and why would we use it
A pull request is important because there can be multiple people working off of the same source code. The pull request shows the changes that someone has made to make sure that everyone is okay with the changes to be committed. 
It gives an opportunity to get feedback from other people about the code that the user wants to merge.
