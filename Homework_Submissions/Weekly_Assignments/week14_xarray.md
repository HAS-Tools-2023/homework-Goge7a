3. Provide a markdown script with your answers to the following questions: 
   1. What were your favorite (or most useful) topics we covered? I am kind of bias since I liked the numpy stuff the most since it was an easier topic. However, being able to create graphs and plots was really cool. 
   2. What did we not cover that you wished we had gotten to? I am not really sure I can think of anything. 
   3. Are you happy with how far you have progressed over the course of the semester? Yes and no. I did learn alot and defeinitely came out of the class knowing way more than when I walked in. However, due to external circumstacnes I was not able to put in the time into the class where I feel like I have mastered the material. 
   4. Any suggestions you have for next years class? My only suggestion is maybe (if the university pays for it) using a program that you can write lines of code for some small exercises would be nice. When I took my C class years ago, I felt like those sort exercises really helped me.
