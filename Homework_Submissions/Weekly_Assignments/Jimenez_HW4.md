In addition to providing a summary of the forecast values you picked and why include the following analysis in your homework submission. Note that questions 3-5 are the same as last weeks questions, however this time you are expected to calculate your answer using the numpy array rather than lists.

1. Include discussion of the quantitative analysis that lead to your prediction. This can include any analysis you complete but must include at least two histograms and some quantitative discussion of flow quantiles that helped you make your decision.

2. Describe the variable flow_data:
  - What is it? It is an array. size
  - What type of values is is composed of? float values
  - What is are its dimensions, and total size? (1268,4), 5072

3. How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of times and as a percentage)? I used the median this time and got a value of 118. There were 519 instances of the flow being greater than 118 in September and a total of 1029. (519/1029)* 100 = 50.4%

4. How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)

5. How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?

6. Reflect on the in class exercises this week. What parts are you having trouble with? Are there questions that don't make sense to you?
