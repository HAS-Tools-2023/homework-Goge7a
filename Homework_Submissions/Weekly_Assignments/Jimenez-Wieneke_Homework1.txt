I used the average flow for a week each year from 1989 to 2023. Each week was the 8/28 - 09/04 except for the year 2023.
I used the most recent information on the page that was accessible which the week of 8/18 - 8/24.
This gave me an estimate of 157.9914 cfs. I did the same technique for the following week except there slightly less data to go off
of since it takes place in the future and I think using this weeks' current data as a duplication would make my average slightly less accurate.
I got an average cfs of 169.6256.
