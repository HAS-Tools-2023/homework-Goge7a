### Grade: 
2/3: Good work I'm glad you are making progress. I'm glad you focused on the coding portions this week. 
- Note though that you still have to answer the questions in the markdown file. I don't see answers to any of the homework questions in this file just your reflection
- Also note that you will wan to submit your python file to me too so that means you should copy your python file when you are done working on it into the 'Weekly_Assignments' folder. 

This week I just guessed on my forecast.

I have been struggling with the course so I decided that this week I would focus on the coding portion and how to submite the homework properly. I hope that do more for loops and I am nervous at how confusing pandas will be. Honestly, if I did not go to office hours I would not have been able to complete the assignment. I do not remember covering np.repeat in class and also just the structure and syntax can be really confusing. At least, I learned how to use the shift+enter commands to see if certain lines of code work or what they do.
