These were some of the changes and help Chat Chat GPT provided me with. 
Originally ChatGPT used an 'f' in front of the https portion for the url to the USGS site. I changed it back to the way we did it in class using plus signs, since 'f' did not make sense to me. 
The docstring did not quite make sense to me so I used ChatGPT to help me write it. I am not really sure why we use them. Comments seem sufficient but Chat GPT just wrote it for me since I was not quite sure how to aside from the ''' at the start and end. 
I was trying to use a numpy function to help me with line and could not figure it out so ChatGPT used this for the lines of code to get it to work. Below:
 print(f"Predicted Streamflow for Next Week: {predicted_next_week} cfs")
 print(f"Predicted Streamflow for Following Week: {predicted_following_week} cfs")
I was really struggling to get this part to work so I this really helped me out. 
Lastly, I wanted to graph to look nice. I was not sure how to structure this at first since I wanted to use < , > but doing it this way really helped me get the graph that I wanted to get. ChatGPT helped me write Lines 83-90 as well. 

Overall, this assignment was very hard for me. I have some understanding on APIs and I definitely see how valuable they are. Docstrings seem less valuable but they are probably important. I was haivng a hard time putting everything together but ChatGPT really helped me out. I was able to put together something that worked and I have a better understading of the parts and pieces since I could ask it specific questions about the lines fo code that I used.
