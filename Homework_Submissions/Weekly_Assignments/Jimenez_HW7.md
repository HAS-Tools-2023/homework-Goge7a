1. I am guessing that the cfs for next week is 70. 
2. ![Plot_1](image.png) I chose flow vs count to create a histogram of the data. 
3. ![Plot_2](image-1.png) I used a log scale scale is shows large scales of a value in compact form.
4. ![Plot_4](image-2.png) I have a scatterplot showing the monthly flow with years plotted on the xy graph. It shows the correlation between the years in a visually distinguishable way.
5. ![Plot_5](image-3.png) This is just a simple hydrograph showing the montly flow with the data. 
6. I think that I have made some progres so far but I have  aways to go. I will spend the extra time I have on the weekends watching videos and trying to write some extra code. I had a lot of trouble with the for loops and I have trouble using pandas. I will keep working at it though.
