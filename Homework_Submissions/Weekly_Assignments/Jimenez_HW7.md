#### Homework 4
#### Robert 

### Grade
2/3: 
- Next time remember to add a header to your markdown and to work on your formatting a bit. I went through and added formatting for you this time so you can see an example of what that looks like. 
- I gave you 2/3 on the graphs because you are missing one and because yours are still very close to what I had in the examples. even if you start from my examples I want to see you modify them significantly -- e.g. changing up colors, style, legend etc etc. 
- I don't see your python script in your homework working folder where it says it should be. For next time just copy your final python script into the submissions folder next to your markdown. 
- Don't give up you are definitely making progress! The more you can practice with these things the better.
  
## Forecast explanation: 
I am guessing that the cfs for next week is 70. 

### Plots: 
#### Plot 1:  
![Plot_1](image.png) I chose flow vs count to create a histogram of the data. 
#### Plot 2: 
![Plot_2](image-1.png) I used a log scale scale is shows large scales of a value in compact form.
#### Plot 3: 
![Plot_4](image-2.png) I have a scatterplot showing the monthly flow with years plotted on the xy graph. It shows the correlation between the years in a visually distinguishable way.
#### Plot 4: 
![Plot_5](image-3.png) This is just a simple hydrograph showing the montly flow with the data. 

### Reflections
I think that I have made some progres so far but I have  aways to go. I will spend the extra time I have on the weekends watching videos and trying to write some extra code. I had a lot of trouble with the for loops and I have trouble using pandas. I will keep working at it though.
