#### Written Assignment: 
Provide a markdown file with a short reflection on:  
1. How you generated your forecast: I generated my forecast this week using a timeseries function to find the median value for the month. 
2. How you made your script better this week: I think that I could have made my script better if I had just found the median for a given week in a month.
3. What you chose to put in a function and why : Aside from it being a requirement. Functions seem to be extremely powerful and useful so being more familiar with it can be essential for coding. 
4. Remaining questions you have or thing you think could be better about your script but you don't know how. I think I should have used week instead of month for my calculation. Maybe I could have added it to the timeseries and instead and used a number like 46 to find a specific week. I was not sure how to go about it but finding the average of a week would be way better for the predictions.
